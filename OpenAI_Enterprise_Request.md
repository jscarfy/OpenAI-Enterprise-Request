Subject: Request for OpenAI Enterprise API & ChatGPT Enterprise â€“ AI-Powered Mathematical Research & Disability Accommodation

Dear OpenAI Enterprise Team,

My name is Pu Justin Scarfy Yang, and I am an independent mathematical researcher focused on AI-driven theorem proving, interdisciplinary mathematics, and the automated discovery of infinite mathematical disciplines.

I am requesting both OpenAI Enterprise API and ChatGPT Enterprise access to enable indefinite, large-scale AI-powered research. My work includes:

ðŸ”¹ Automated, AI-driven theorem development â€“ Running an infinite number of AI-augmented theorem proving projects, each devoted to a completely distinct mathematical subject.
ðŸ”¹ Real-time mathematical structuring & interdisciplinary research â€“ Using ChatGPT Enterprise for interactive theorem proving, conceptual expansion, and interdisciplinary AI research applications.
ðŸ”¹ Infinite, pairwise disjoint research topics â€“ Unlike traditional research, my work does not stop; each mathematical discipline develops indefinitely, and each branch expands recursively.

â¸»

ðŸš¨ Why This Request is Critical
	1.	I Have a Disability That Requires AI Assistance
	â€¢	At 15 years old, I suffered a full 13+ minute cardiac arrest, complete renal failure, and severe hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) due to medical malpractice in Canada.
	â€¢	I was in a vegetative state for 3 months but have since recovered to continue my research.
	â€¢	I am permanently dependent on dialysis & transplant medications, which limits my ability to process large-scale research manually.
	â€¢	AI is the only way I can continue my mathematical work at scale.
	2.	I Am Financially Limited to a Disability Pension Due to 20 Years of Systemic Canadian Medical Negligence
	â€¢	Due to 20 years of ongoing systemic medical negligence in Canada, I am unable to work in a traditional academic institution.
	â€¢	My only financial support is my disability pension, which makes standard enterprise AI access financially impossible for me.
	â€¢	OpenAI must consider AI as an accessibility tool, rather than a luxury, for researchers with disabilities.
	3.	Current OpenAI API Limits Prevent Indefinite AI Research Expansion
	â€¢	My research is not a finite problem; it expands indefinitely.
	â€¢	Current API limits prevent continuous AI-driven mathematical discovery.
	â€¢	I require continuous AI assistance for an infinite number of research branches, each operating as an independent AI-moderated mathematical research topic.
	4.	ChatGPT Plus Does Not Support Indefinite Conversations
	â€¢	Enterprise ChatGPT must allow indefinite, infinitely recursive research conversations to support AI-augmented theorem proving at an infinite scale.
	â€¢	My work requires ChatGPT Enterprise to operate at unrestricted length, ensuring AI can expand and refine each topic indefinitely.
	5.	OpenAIâ€™s Responsibility for Disability Inclusion
	â€¢	AI is a crucial accessibility tool for me to continue pushing the boundaries of mathematical discovery.
	â€¢	Denying access to a disabled researcher striving to pioneer AI-assisted mathematics would contradict OpenAIâ€™s mission.
	â€¢	I am requesting fair accommodations to ensure I can continue my AI-powered research indefinitely.

ðŸ“Œ Request Summary

âœ… ChatGPT Enterprise with indefinite conversation length â€“ To support infinite recursive theorem development.
âœ… Enterprise API Access with no rate limits â€“ To allow automated, infinite-scale theorem proving and formal verification.
âœ… Disability accommodations â€“ Due to 20 years of systemic medical negligence in Canada, I am financially limited to a disability pension, making AI my only viable research tool.
âœ… Consideration for OpenAIâ€™s Researcher Access Program â€“ If direct enterprise access is unavailable, I request API subsidies or nonprofit pricing.

I am happy to provide documentation on my disability and research scope.

I appreciate your time and consideration and look forward to your response.

Best regards,
Pu Justin Scarfy Yang
Independent Researcher
