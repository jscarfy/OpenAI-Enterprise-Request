# OpenAI-Enterprise-Request
Formal request for OpenAI Enterprise API &amp; ChatGPT Enterprise access due to disability &amp; financial constraints.

# 🚀 Request for OpenAI Enterprise API & ChatGPT Enterprise Access  
## 🔹 AI-Powered Mathematical Research & Disability Accommodation  

### 📌 Overview  
My name is **Pu Justin Scarfy Yang**, and I am an independent mathematical researcher working on **AI-driven theorem proving, interdisciplinary mathematics, and the automated discovery of infinite mathematical disciplines**.  

I am requesting **both OpenAI Enterprise API and ChatGPT Enterprise access** to enable **indefinite, large-scale AI-powered research**.  

---

## 🔹 Why This Request is Critical  

### 1️⃣ **I Have a Disability That Requires AI Assistance**  
- At **15 years old**, I suffered a **full 13+ minute cardiac arrest**, complete **renal failure**, and **severe hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE)** due to **medical malpractice in Canada**.  
- I was in a **vegetative state for 3 months** but have since recovered to continue my research.  
- I am **permanently dependent on dialysis & transplant medications**, which limits my ability to process large-scale research manually.  
- **AI is the only way I can continue my mathematical work at scale**.  

### 2️⃣ **I Am Financially Limited to a Disability Pension Due to 20 Years of Systemic Canadian Medical Negligence**  
- Due to **20 years of ongoing systemic medical negligence in Canada**, I am **unable to work in a traditional academic institution**.  
- My **only financial support is my disability pension**, which makes standard enterprise AI access financially impossible for me.  
- OpenAI **must consider AI as an accessibility tool**, rather than a luxury, for researchers with disabilities.  

### 3️⃣ **Current OpenAI API Limits Prevent Indefinite AI Research Expansion**  
- My research is **not a finite problem**; it **expands indefinitely**.  
- **Current API limits prevent continuous AI-driven mathematical discovery**.  
- I require **continuous AI assistance** for an **infinite number of research branches**, each operating as an independent AI-moderated mathematical research topic.  

### 4️⃣ **ChatGPT Plus Does Not Support Indefinite Conversations**  
- **Enterprise ChatGPT must allow indefinite, infinitely recursive research conversations** to **support AI-augmented theorem proving at an infinite scale**.  
- **My work requires ChatGPT Enterprise to operate at unrestricted length**, ensuring AI can expand and refine each topic indefinitely.  

### 5️⃣ **OpenAI’s Responsibility for Disability Inclusion**  
- **AI is a crucial accessibility tool** for me to **continue pushing the boundaries of mathematical discovery**.  
- Denying access to a **disabled researcher striving to pioneer AI-assisted mathematics** would contradict OpenAI’s mission.  
- I am requesting **fair accommodations** to ensure I can continue my **AI-powered research indefinitely**.

## 🔹 **What I Am Requesting**  
✅ **ChatGPT Enterprise with indefinite conversation length** – To support **infinite recursive theorem development**.  
✅ **Enterprise API Access with no rate limits** – To allow **automated, infinite-scale theorem proving and formal verification**.  
✅ **Disability accommodations** – Due to **20 years of systemic medical negligence in Canada**, I am **financially limited to a disability pension**, making AI my **only viable research tool**.  
✅ **Consideration for OpenAI’s Researcher Access Program** – If direct enterprise access is unavailable, I request **API subsidies or nonprofit pricing**.
